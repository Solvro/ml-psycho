# Human Tech / Solvro PSYCHO

A sophisticated patient simulator built with Python and Large Language Models to help psychology students practice therapeutic techniques on realistic virtual patients.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive learning environment where psychology students can engage with AI-powered virtual patients that exhibit various psychological conditions, personality traits, and behavioral patterns. The simulator helps future psychologists develop their clinical skills in a safe, controlled environment before working with real patients.

## Features

- **Realistic Patient Personas**: AI-generated patients with diverse backgrounds, conditions, and personalities
- **Interactive Therapy Sessions**: Natural language conversations that simulate real therapeutic interactions
- **Multiple Psychological Conditions**: Support for various mental health scenarios including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and more
- **Session Analytics**: Track conversation patterns, therapeutic techniques used, and patient responses
- **Learning Feedback**: AI-powered analysis of therapeutic approaches and suggestions for improvement
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Create specific patient profiles and therapeutic situations for targeted learning

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core application development
- **UV**: Modern Python package management and project setup
- **LangChain**: LLM orchestration and prompt management
- **LangGraph**: Complex conversation flow management and state handling
- **LangSmith**: Monitoring, debugging, and optimization of LLM interactions
- **Large Language Models**: Advanced AI models for realistic patient simulation

## Project Structure


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- UV package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ml-psycho
```

2. Install dependencies using UV:

```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LLM API keys and configuration
```

## Educational Benefits

- **Safe Learning Environment**: Practice without risk to real patients
- **Diverse Case Studies**: Exposure to various psychological conditions and patient types
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time analysis of therapeutic approaches
- **Repeatable Scenarios**: Practice the same situation multiple times with different approaches
- **Skill Development**: Build confidence in clinical interviewing and therapeutic techniques
